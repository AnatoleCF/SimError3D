Hello, my name is Mary. And you, what is your name?
I am really glad to meet you.
How old are you?
You're big now!
Tell me ... What grade are you in?
That's good!
Would you like to read a story with me?
Before starting, I have to tell you that, at the half of the story, I will have to leave and let my friend finish the story. You see?
" Let's start now! You will see how funny this story is. It's called ""The perched ball""."
Ready?
Let's goooooo! Can you see the picture?
It's morning, and all children arrive at school. Oh, look at him, he doesn't see really happy to be here!
And here, this small boy with his ball, it's Salim.
"He calls his friends ""Hey Guys, there is still some time before the bell rings, who wants to play with me ? Sebastien and Cindy scream « Me me ! ». « Let's go then! »"
The game is starting, and Sebastien pulls hard in the ball. Wooow, the ball flies really high!
Oh my god, where will the ball land? Do you know it?
What a disaster!!! Booyah! Check out the ball! It's stuck on the roof!
But how are we going to get it back now?
Oh my god! Look next to the ball! What for an idea !?! He threw up his carrot on the roof!
Look at Salim! He is in stocking feet!! That's not really clever...
I know, it's his carrot which is on the roof, yes!! Tell me, we call this a carrot, right?
Yes, you are right ! It's not a carrot, but a boot.
Hum, wait! We do not call this in that way ?! Hum, now I remember, it's called a boot.
Yes, that's it. Salim threw up his boot to drop the ball !!!
Duh ! he missed it ! The ball is still stuck and the carro... hem, I mean the boot is also stuck now !
