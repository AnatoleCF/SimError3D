        <h1>Nareca</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
        This directory contains narration data. It is divided into three
        subfolders:

        <dl>
            <dt><strong><code>data/</code></strong>
            <dd>
            Contains a few CSV files that each contain a story to narrate. A
            story includes phrases to tell, what the user can possibly say at
            each step, what to answer to such responses, as well as a few
            directives that enable to show pictures or change the title of the
            window.

            <dd>
            More precisely, those CSV files have the following columns,
            separated by a semi-column (<q>;</q>):
            <ul>
                <li>Step number
                <li>Commands to execute at the beginning of the step (see
                    <a href="#commands">below</a> for a list of possible
                    commands), separated by a vertical pipe character (<q>|</q>)
                <li>Story text for the current step
                <li>Possible user input (what follows is then dependant on the
                    actual response of the user matching the provided pattern)
                <li>Possible answer to such input
                <li>Commands to execute after answering
                <li>Number of the next step
            </ul>

            <dt><strong><code>scenario/</code></strong>
            <dd>
            This folder contains a single story to narrate. It consists of the
            following files:

            <dl>
                <dt><code>story/Story.xml</code>
                <dd>
                This XML file contains the text of each story step as well as
                the <a href="#commands">commands</a> that should be executed
                prior to speaking.

                <dt><code>steps/Step_&lt;i&gt;.xml</code>
                <dd>
                Each of these files corresponds to a step of the story and
                indicates the patterns of the answers that the user could give.
                Those patterns are given in the Synnbad syntax and,
                additionally, <q>wxcvbn</q> corresponds to an absence of answer.

                <dt><code>slides/slide&lt;i&gt;.png</code>
                <dd>
                Pictures that can be shown to the user using the
                <code>displaySlide &lt;i&gt;</code> command.

                <dt><code>outOfContext/OutOfContext.xml</code>
                <dd>
                This file defines <q>fallback</q> answers. It can be thought as
                patterns that are implicitly added at the end of every
                <code>steps/Step_&lt;i&gt;.xml</code> file.
            </dl>

            <dt><strong><code>script/</code></strong>
            <dd>
            Contains a few convenience scripts to work with the CSV files in
            <code>data/</code>. You need to have
            <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/">Groovy</a> installed to run some
            of them.

            <dd>
            Those scripts are:
            <dl>
                <dt><code>emptyGenerator.groovy</code>
                <dd>
                Converts a text file containing one sentence per line into a
                basic CSV file.

                <dt><code>scriptGenerator.groovy</code>
                <dd>
                Converts a CSV file into a folder suitable for use as
                <code>scenario/</code> (except for <code>outOfContext</code> or
                the slides, which are not generated).

                <dt><code>storyGenerator.bash</code>
                <dd>
                Although it technically is not, it can be seen as the
                composition of the previous two scripts: from a simple text
                file, it generates a basic <code>scenario/</code> structure.

                <dt><code>storyRecovery.groovy</code>
                <dd>
                Extracts the text of a story from its CSV file.
            </dl>
        </dl>

        <h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>

        <p>
        Several commands can be used inside stories:

        <h3><code>displaySlide</code></h3>

        <p>
        Sets the slide that should be displayed for the current step. For
        example:

        <pre><code>displaySlide 5</code></pre>
        will make it so <code>slides/slide_5.png</code> will be displayed.

        <h3><code>changeTitle</code></h3>

        <p>
        Changes the title of the window. For example:
        <pre><code>changeTitle My story</code></pre>
    </body>
</html>
