14;;And here, this small boy with his ball, it's Salim.;;;;15;
15;;"He calls his friends ""Hey Guys, there is still some time before the bell rings, who wants to play with me ? Sebastien and Cindy scream « Me me ! ». « Let's go then! »";;;;16;
16;;The game is starting, and Sebastien pulls hard in the ball. Wooow, the ball flies really high!;;;;17;
17;;Oh my god, where will the ball land? Do you know it?;;;;18;
18;;What a disaster!!! Booyah! Check out the ball! It's stuck on the roof!;;;;19;
19;;But how are we going to get it back now?;;;;20;
20;;Oh my god! Look next to the ball! What for an idea !?! He threw up his carrot on the roof!;;;;21;
21;;Look at Salim! He is in stocking feet!! That's not really clever...;;;;22;
22;;I know, it's his carrot which is on the roof, yes!! Tell me, we call this a carrot, right?;;;;23;
23;;Yes, you are right ! It's not a carrot, but a boot.;;;;24;
24;;Hum, wait! We do not call this in that way ?! Hum, now I remember, it's called a boot.;;;;25;
25;;Yes, that's it. Salim threw up his boot to drop the ball !!!;;;;26;
26;;Duh ! he missed it ! The ball is still stuck and the carro... hem, I mean the boot is also stuck now !;;;;27;
